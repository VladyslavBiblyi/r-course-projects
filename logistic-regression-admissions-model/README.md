# Logistic Regression: Graduate School Admissions Model

This project builds a logistic regression model to predict admission outcomes using the UCLA graduate admissions dataset. 
The analysis evaluates predictors such as GRE score, GPA, and institutional ranking.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Logistic regression modeling (`glm`)
- Odds ratios and percent-change interpretation
- McFadden’s pseudo-R² and model fit evaluation
- ROC curve creation and threshold optimization
- Confusion matrix classification

## Key Files
- logistic-regression-admissions-model.R
- Dataset loaded from UCLA Stats website

This project illustrates my ability to work with classification models, interpret coefficients, and evaluate predictive performance.
