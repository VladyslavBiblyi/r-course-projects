# Shiny Dashboard: Marathon Performance Explorer

This project is an interactive Shiny web application that allows users to explore marathon runner performance. Users can filter by gender, age range, weekly training miles, and race conditions, and view results through scatterplots, histograms, boxplots, summary statistics, and a dynamic data table.

## Features
- Interactive filtering of runner attributes
- Multiple plot types (scatter, histogram, boxplot)
- Adjustable axes and color mappings
- Reactive summary statistics
- Searchable and filterable data table

## Skills Demonstrated
- Shiny UI and server structure (`ui`, `server`)
- Reactive expressions and dynamic plots
- `ggplot2` visualization in reactive contexts
- Building full interactive analytical tools

## Key Files
- marathon-shiny-dashboard.R
- Dataset: marathon_runs.csv

This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive dashboards for exploratory analytics.
