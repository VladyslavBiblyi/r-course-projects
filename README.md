# 🇷 R Course Projects

This folder contains a collection of R projects completed across my coursework, showcasing skills 
in data cleaning, statistical modeling, exploratory analysis, and interactive app development. 
The projects span logistic regression, multiple and polynomial regression, full data-wrangling pipelines, 
customer analytics, and the creation of a Shiny dashboard using real-world datasets.

Each subfolder includes reproducible R scripts, datasets, and a brief README describing the project’s purpose, methods, and key insights.
