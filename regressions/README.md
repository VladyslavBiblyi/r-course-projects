# Regression Modeling: Marketing Performance & Employee Productivity

This project contains two applied regression analyses.  
**Part 1:** A marketing dataset is used to model revenue based on ad spend, pricing strategy, email subscribers, and marketing channel.  
**Part 2:** An employee productivity dataset is analyzed using both linear and quadratic models to understand how work hours and experience affect productivity.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Multiple linear regression
- Model comparison with ANOVA
- Residual diagnostics and visualization
- Polynomial (quadratic) regression
- Hypothesis testing and interpretation

## Key Files
- marketing-and-productivity-regression.R
- Data files: `marketing_channel_sales.xlsx`, `employee_productivity_hours.xlsx`

This project highlights modeling, diagnostics, and real-world interpretation in business analytics.
