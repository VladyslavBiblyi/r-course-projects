# Data Cleaning & Modeling Pipeline: Subscription Customers

This project performs a full data-cleaning workflow on a customer subscription dataset, including name standardization, 
typo correction, duplicate detection, missing-value handling, and outlier treatment. After cleaning, the project applies 
ANOVA, multiple regression, clustering, and logistic regression to explore customer behavior and churn.

## Skills Demonstrated
- `tidyverse` data wrangling (cleaning, recoding, restructuring)
- Detecting and fixing category inconsistencies
- Outlier handling and median imputation
- ANOVA for group comparisons
- Linear regression for spend prediction
- K-means clustering for customer segmentation
- Logistic regression for churn prediction

## Key Files
- subscription-customer-data-cleaning.R
- Dataset: subscription_customers_raw.csv

This project simulates a professional data-cleaning and modeling pipeline commonly used in analytics roles.
